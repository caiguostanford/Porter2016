Inferring Identity From Language: Linguistic Intergroup Bias Informs Social Categorization

Psychological Science

Porter et al.. (2016)

#Justification for project choice

I chose Porter et al. (2016) because it is very relevant to my own research program, which examines how language shapes our social cognition especially in regard to social categorization. In their paper, Porter et al. examined how favorable (describe good aspects with abstract descriptions and bad aspects with concrete descriptions) versus unfavorable (describe good aspects with concrete descriptions and bad aspects with abstract descriptions) language bias can influence people's inferences about social group memberships. Specifically, they found that upon hearing the protagonist describing another individual with favorable language bias, people would assume that the protagonist and the individual had the same political affiliation, whereas they would infer that they had different political affiliations if the protagonist used showed unfavorable language bias in his descriptions of the other individual. Moreover, they found that participants' own political affiliations moderated their preference for the protagonist regarding whether the protagonist demonstrated favorable or unfavorable language bias when describing a Democrat or Republican. Specifically, Democratic-identified participants showed preferences for the protagnist who demonstrated favorable language bias when describing a Democrat (participants' in-group member), whereas Republican-identified participants did not show this pattern. I think this moderation is especially interesting and worthy of replication given the current political climate. It is possible that, due to the increased polarization, both Democratic and Republican identified participants would show greater preference for people who demonstrated favorable language bias when describing participants' respective in-group members. 

#Stimuli and Procedure.
The stimuli for this study are passages that include vignettes where a person is describing another person whose nationality and political affiliation are given. Depending on the manipulation of language bias and target's political affiliation, participants would receive different passages but the structure and format of the passages would be the same across conditions. After reading the stimuli, participants would be asked to infer the politocal affiliation of the protagonist (the person who does the describing) -- that is, whether the protagonist has the same or different political affiliation as/from the target. They will also be asked to rate how likely they themselves would be friends with the protagonist (measuring preference). 

#Challenge
I think the challenge is the target's political affiliation is given indirectly by whom they voted for in the 2008 election (McCain vs. Obama). Since the most recent election drew unprecedented attention, I am not sure if we should use the most recent election as our manipulation or stick to the original version used by the authors. I think the most recent election is definitely much more valence-loaded than the 2008 one. This might significantly influence participants' responses regarding how likely they would be friends with the protagonist and the valence might also confound the language bias's effect.
